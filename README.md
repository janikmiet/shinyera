# Exposure Response Analysis

This tool is used for exploring population health with certain diagnoses. For example we want to explore sleep apnea patients (ICD-10 code G47) and what other common diagnoses they have. Then we can select response diagnoses, for example hypertension (ICD-10 code I10), and explore how sleep apnea patients will get this diagnose during the time. 

With application you can use regex code (ex. ^G47 | ^G31) to select diagnose group. You can also select which registries are used as a source. Application is also able to log user input and runs. We restricted application show information only for population which has 6 or more persons.

This Project is heavily integrated with functions in ['healthpopR'](https://janikmiet.github.io/healthpopR/)-package. 

## Common Data model

Application uses mainly two dataset `population` and `diagnoses`. Make sure that the data you are using is corresponding to common data model.

### `population`

| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| ID | person ID variable  | 
| DATE_BIRTH | Date of person birthday | 
| DATE_DEATH | Date of person death date or NA  | 
| DATE_MIGRATION | Date of person migration or NA  | 

### `diagnoses`

| VARIABLE       | DESCRIPTION | 
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| ID | person ID variable | 
| DGREG | Information of diagnose registry. Example ICD10, ICD9 or ICD8 or FRACTURES registry | 
| SRC |  Diagnose registry source. Example Hilmo, Cancer etc. healthcare registry |  
| DATE | Date of event  | 
| DG | Diagnose code  |  
| ICD10_3LETTERS | NA or in case of ICD10 code, icd code in 3 letters  | 
| ICD10_CLASS | | NA or in case of ICD10 code, icd class (upper definition)  | 
| DATE_BIRTH | Person date of birth | 
| AGE | Age of the event |
